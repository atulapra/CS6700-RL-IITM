# CS6700-RL-IITM

* This repository contains assignments for the course CS6700 (Reinforcement Learning) at IIT Madras.  
* There are solutions to the written assignments as well as the screening and reading assignments (summary of chapters and papers) to be done as a pre-requisite for projects.  
* I have also provided an example to learn how to setup environments in the `EnvExample` folder, which will be useful in programming assignments.
